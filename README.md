# Ammo.js Typings

TypeScript type definitions for [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)

## What is Ammo.js?

[Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) is direct port of the [Bullet physics engine](http://bulletphysics.org) to JavaScript using [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org).

## Why should I use this package while there are other packages?

There wasn't a complete type definitions package for [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) before this project has started. This package is developed by parsing official [WebIDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_IDL) bindings of [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) which can be found at [https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/master/ammo.idl](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/blob/master/ammo.idl).

## Usage

Currently, there is no NPM package yet. But, you can use it anyway by using following command:

$ npm install github:osman-turan/ammo.js-typings
```
